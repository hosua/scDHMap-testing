# scDHMap-testing
I am not the original author of scDHMap and this repository is not meant for others to be used. Please use the original at [scDHMap](https://github.com/ttgump/scDHMap) if you want to use scDHMap.

In here are some scripts I am using to render the data models of scDHMap, everything in here is still experimental.
